### What is the value of x at the end of the following code?

# This question in the asssesment is to test your knowledege regarding how much of the interpretation you can do yourself in your mind using the concepts you learnt and remember.

# This is a simple for loop, but the range function takes 3 parameters. 
# The first one is the starting point of range, the second one is the limit of the range and the last one is the value of increamentation. 
for x in range(1, 10, 3):
    print(x)
    
# The upper limit of a range isnâ€™t included, which means that the loop stops before reaching it. The increment is 3, so the loop stops when x reaches 7 and prints 7
